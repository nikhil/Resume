fontawesome -- high quality web icons

The "fontawesome" package grants access to 302 web-related icons provided by the
included "Font Awesome" free font, designed by Dave Gandy and released under
the open SIL Open Font License (available at http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).
See http://www.fontawesome.io for more details about the font itself.

This package requires the "fontspec" package and either the Xe(La)TeX or
Lua(La)TeX engine to load the included otf font.

Once the package is loaded, icons can be accessed through the general \faicon
command, which takes as argument the name of the desired icon, or through direct
commands specific to each icon. The full list of icon designs, names and direct
commands is showcased in the manual.
